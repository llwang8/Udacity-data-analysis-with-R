# Data Analysis with R

Exploratory data analysis is an approach for summarizing and visualizing the important characteristics of a data set. Promoted by John Tukey, exploratory data analysis focuses on exploring data to understand the dataâ€™s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, to consider how that data set came into existence, and to decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods.

## Project - White Wine Quality Exploration With R

The purpose of this project is to determine what physicochemical properties affect white wine quality through exploratory data analysis of a data set containing attributes for approximately 5,000 white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine using R.
